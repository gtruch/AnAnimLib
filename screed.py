.. caution::    

  Tutorials (this one included) 
  showing said user how the library solves
  a prototypical problem in a new/better way by leading them through *our*
  solution to said problem.  This  approach, while logical, unintentionally
  presents our solution as though it sprang into existance fully formed, a fact
  that anyone who builds things knows is absurd.  

  As my great grandaddy, a famed SuperWidget builder, would say to anyone who
  would listen: "The only way to master SuperWidget building is to *fail* at
  building a *lot* of SuperWidgets."  Then he'd brag about the number fingers he
  lost in various SuperWidget accidents.  You know. To show how many times he
  failed. 

  Or, as my friends in the Fortnight forums say when asked how to win at Battle
  Royale:  "Git gud!"  which translates roughly to: "Play a bunch.  Die
  a bunch. Then, figure out how to not die so much.  Then... Die less."  You know.  Lose
  a finger.  
  
  Grand Daddy and the Fortnight trolls are saying the same thing:  The path to
  mastery is through failure. Along the way, you might lose a finger.  You might
  might even get some bad feels because a mean troll keeps killing you.  And
  that's just fine. Every lost finger or death by obnoxious adolescent is a
  lesson learned.  Or something.  Great Grandad would know.  

  The point is, nobody writes about the failures because we would
  look foolish!  Some brave soul should rise to the occasion and write an honest
  tutorial that highlights the lessons learned at the absolute
  lowest point in the project cycle.  I am not that person.
